## Dimensionality Reduction & Principal Component Analysis(PCA)

When dealing with high dimensional data, that is, dataset with many dimensions or features, there are possible issues (usually term the *curse of dimensionality*) that arises such as multicollinearity (correlation among the features causing model bias) and overfitting. Dimensionality reduction helps solve this problem. 

The basic idea of dimensionality reduction is to represent the dataset by using fewer dimension of features than in the original dataset. This can often be done through various feature selection or elimination techniques including the use of domain knowledge as well as through the use *feature extraction* techniques to create a new set of features that are a linear and non-linear transformation of the original. The **PCA** is a popular approach to feature extraction that transform the high dimensional data (many features) into lower dimension (fewer features) while retaining most of the information in the original dataset.

In this practical, I implement dimensionality reduction using the PCA.

**The data for this practical was obtained from the IBM cloud storage**.
